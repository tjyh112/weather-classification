-Command to run: We prefer run .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook. Although we also have .py file. To run it, enter "python3 weather_prediction.py", and it will give the same result.

-Order of execution: We put everything in one file, so there is no specific order of execution.
library needed: pandas, numpy, scipy, skimage.io, re, glob, sklearn.

-folders needed: katkam-scaled, yvr-weather. (all input files are in these folders, and it will be read automatically when the program is running)
